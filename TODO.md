# pgm-studio — TODO (current focus)

The **Now & Next** board — only the *current focus theme* lives here. Everything not in the immediate
slice is in **`BACKLOG.md`** (the long tail); shipped capabilities are in **`FEATURES.md`** (the Done
column). The three move left → right: **`BACKLOG.md` → `TODO.md` → `FEATURES.md`**.

**Holds only open work:** `[ ]` to-do, `[~]` in progress — **never `[x]`.** When a task ships, a commit
lands (its message references the id), the task **leaves this file**, and a line is added to `FEATURES.md`.
When this board drains, pull the next theme up from `BACKLOG.md`. Board rules live in `CLAUDE.md`
(§ "Status & task board").

Task ids are a section letter + number (`S13`, `B10`, `G15`) — **globally unique and stable** across all
three files. Moving a task between files never changes its id; never renumber or reuse.

## Layout generation (G) — current focus: box-driven map generation (box per box, simplicity first)

Phase 2 of plan-then-realize. The consolidation base is in: M0 + M1 (G58/G59) and the evaluator engine
with its hard gate, soft-term foundation, frontline/rotation terms and editor wiring (the G60 foundation —
all in `FEATURES.md`). **This board is the box model, end to end**: one box kind at a time, each step
reusing what the previous one proved — wool boxes **shipped** (G61), the mask-level corner law **shipped**
(G79 — its pinch scan `Cells.HasDiagonalPinch` is the primitive the docking work reuses), the mirror's
slot recovery **shipped** (G62 — `SlotAssignment`), and the spawn box **shipped** (G78 — `SpawnBoxEmitter`,
the second box kind, the profile-driven fill spine **shipped** (G41-A part 1 — `FillProfiles` + `BoxFiller`,
the lever box footprint enforcement turns on), the interface data model **shipped** (G41-B —
`BoxInterfaces`, the valid-edges facts), the docking gate **shipped** (G80 — `DockingGate`, the declarative
slot-edge table the partitioner produces legal docks against), and the partition constraint-graph **shipped**
(G63-A — `BoxPartition` + the `Of` derive mirror), and the partition-first allocator seam **shipped** (G63-B —
`BoxPartitioner` (`budget → BoxPartition`) + the two-currency budget check, parallel to the grower; all in
`FEATURES.md`) → **the switch (G63-C) is next**, where sampling fills the allocated partition through `BoxFiller`,
wires `DockingGate`, retires `TeamUnitGrower` and re-baselines. Each box
kind gets its **shape profile as data** (what shapes a spawn can be:
{I, L}, small boxes per SP; what a wool entry admits: the §4 width menu), and the slot labels the
emissions carry are what every later rule binds to (`docs/contracts/map-generation.md` §5.3: the labels
drive, the mirror only verifies).

Deliberately **not** here: the G60 soft-rule long tail (parked in `BACKLOG.md` — discovering soft rules
for structures the composer can't yet compose is the wrong stage; the crammed-frontline dead end, G69, is
the lesson), G32's remaining realize subtracks (parked — elevation is one of the last pipeline steps),
(the emitter placement knobs G50–G52 shipped — `FEATURES.md`). The G32-D seed goldens freeze only
**after G63** — every milestone below re-keys the RNG, so earlier goldens would just re-break.

**Box model — M2 → M4**

*(G41 was one monolith bundling four separable concerns; split into A–D so the footprint slice could ship
without the open-variant patterns. A + B shipped; C's open-variant **hub/frontline emission is now promoted
into the current focus** — split into **G88 (hub)** + **G89 (frontline)** below — because those two complete
the team unit (hub + spawn + wool + frontline) the switch fills; D (vacancy publishing) stays parked in
`BACKLOG.md`.)*

- [~] **G41-A — [M3] Route the production arms through `BoxFiller` (part 2 — closes with G63).** Part 1
  shipped (`FEATURES.md`): `FillProfiles` (the per-`BoxKind` profile as a type) + `BoxFiller` (the one
  profile-gated fill entry point over a positioned `Box`, with land-vs-`Box.LandTargetCells` accounting), and
  the wool menu reads `FillProfiles` (byte-identical). **Remaining:** the production wool + spawn arms still
  size their own boxes with the bespoke `SolveDepth`/`SolveWidth`/`spawnLen` solvers and place via `PlaceArm`/
  `PlaceSpawn`'s host-window and (u,v)-frame logic — they do **not** yet route through `BoxFiller`, because
  that needs the arm's box **Rect allocated first** (position + dims), which is exactly the partition-first
  inversion. So retiring the bespoke sizing + the **intra-box fragment** that fills to the land target
  (convert land→build inside the box per the §5.3 slot cut law) land together with **G63-C**'s box-Rect
  allocation — `BoxFiller` is the filler that switch drives. Depends on G63-C. (review §4.1, §8)

*(The G88/G89 pre-work has all shipped — the language (G94), the binding (G95), the edge taxonomy + publish
policy (G92), interval facts (G93), and **both team-unit box kinds**: the **hub box (G88)** and the **frontline
box (G89)**, together carrying the **offer type + both producer halves (G96)** — see `FEATURES.md`. What remains
of the arc is the offer **consumer**: the spine of **G63-C** below — the composer routes through the partitioner,
the hub emits first setting the neighbour menus, the mid consumes the frontline face offer, and
`TeamUnitGrower`'s team-unit authoring retires. That is where the language finally shrinks the code.)*

*(G63 was one monolith — the whole box-driven switch. Split A–D: A shipped the partition data model + mirror,
B shipped the partition-first allocator seam + budget check (both `FEATURES.md`); C flips the switch (fill + wire
+ retire + re-baseline); D — the generic fragment, `GrowthOrder` strategies, and vacancy allocation — is parked
in `BACKLOG.md`.)*

- [~] **G63-C — [M4] The switch (fill the partition, retire the grower, re-baseline).** *Landed, organ by organ:
  (1) the docking gate is wired into `BoxFiller` — `DockingGate.CheckMouth` over the box's edges (`BoxInterfaces.Of`)
  makes the filler **produce only legal docks**, an illegal one a directed `FillResult.IllegalDock`. (1a) `BoxFiller`
  fills all **four mouths** (Left/Right via a quarter-turn of the mouth-up shape — rects, marker, vacancies). (1b)
  the **wool arm routes through the plan-cell `BoxFiller`** (`FillArm` retires `PlaceArm`): the box footprint is
  allocated first and the fill sized to it (**footprint an input**), seated by its mouth row in the host window; the
  wool arm's RNG re-keys (first churn — suite still green: tests gate invariants/authored seeds, composer goldens
  freeze after G63). (1c) the shared four-mouth orientation is extracted to `MouthOrient`, and the **spawn arm routes
  through the plan-cell fill** too (`FillSpawn`; `SpawnBoxEmitter.Fill` takes a plan-cell `Box`+mouth), the entry run
  re-pinned for the wool-on-spawn dock — byte-identical for I / L-dir≥0 spawns.* **Remaining (the switch's own spine),
  broken into sub-steps:** with all four **team-unit** kinds now boxes (G88/G89), invert grow-then-derive to
  **allocate-then-fill**, hub first — **C.1 ✓ landed** (`TeamUnitFiller.Fill`: fills an allocated partition hub-first
  into a `FilledUnit` — hub/spawn/wool/frontline, each neighbour consuming the hub's `EdgeOffer` width as its `cw`,
  the frontline's face offer carried out for the mid; the one board-frame input is the spawn facing; synthetic
  fixtures, no golden churn) → **C.2 (in progress)** the allocator (`TeamUnitAllocator`). *Landed:* the placement
  plan (`SamplePlan`/`UnitPlan` — spawn on the back **or a lateral side**, wools assigned around it: free sides
  first, back preferred, a 3rd doubling onto the spawn's side); the hub + spawn + wool box-Rect geometry from the
  budget (generic share sizing, under-budget OK); the per-edge `EdgeOffer` plan on the joints (offered width = the
  lane `w`); **the allocator owns the hub-form choice** — it samples a form and seats neighbours on that form's
  **real free-edge intervals** (the offerable surface, §1.13, read off the hub's own emitted offers), falling back
  to the solid rectangle when a form's free edges cannot host the plan; the chosen form rides on `Box.Form` for the
  filler to re-emit (so allocator and filler agree on the body and every dock lands on real terrain); and **no
  diagonal pinches**, now gated by the **mass-level corner law** (`Cells.HasDiagonalPinch` over the composed mask,
  not the coarse rect-pair proxy — a multi-piece hub's ¾-solid bridged corner reads clean). The allocate→fill loop
  closes end-to-end and `tools/compose/unit-gallery.cs` renders it (0 pinches; Ring hubs appear). *Remaining, roughly in order:*
    - **Hub-form richness (orientation + size).** The forms are built spine-first (`BodyEmitter`'s canonical frame),
      so a branch/holed form's solid edges face the unused **front** while its arms/feet face the used back — so `L`/`U`
      mostly **fall back** to the rectangle today (only `Ring`, all-full outer edges, lands reliably; `Double-hole` needs
      a hub wider than the current caps). Orient the chosen form (arms toward the free front) so `L`/`U` land on the
      demanded back/lateral sides, making the menu **common, not just reachable** — the arm-placement knob (§1.14).
    - **Wool & spawn shape richness** — layouts are "very basic" (mostly `I`): the **spawn is I-only** (the L's
      overhanging foot needs the entry-seat-and-shift — seat by the entry width `w`, let the box overhang free
      space), and the **wool** boxes are generic-share-sized so the fill mostly lands `I`; give them family/size
      variety (L/Z/scythe/…).
    - **Frontline** — the front side + its reach (shifts `hubUMin` toward the axis), the `FrontForm` dims, and the
      **face offer** (`FrontlineBoxEmitter`, grouping joint/several) carried into `FilledUnit.FrontlineFace`.
    - **Hub-floor refinement** — the frontline / twin-recess / wool-c clearance floors the grower's `HubVFloor`
      encodes (today a simplified `w+2` floor).
    - **CT1 / LN2 invariants by construction** — ≥10-block image clearance (orbit images stay separate islands)
      and the 50-block chain cap, baked into placement, failing the attempt if unmet (no repair loop).
    - **Wire** `BoxPartitioner.Partition` to return the allocation (+ the crossing `design` the frontline reach
      needs), replacing `BoxPartition.Of(grow)`.
  → **C.3** wire `Composer` through C.2→C.1 and **retire `TeamUnitGrower`'s authoring** (RNG re-keys, goldens churn)
  → **C.4** the clamp's **dual-host corner-wrap** → **C.5** re-baseline gallery cases, **then** freeze the G32-D
  goldens. `MidCarver` stays — the mid is not a team-unit box, it is derived (`f(frontline)`, consuming the frontline
  face offer). *Deliberately NOT next: the
  fill-to-`LandTargetCells` **directed repair** (retiring `SolveDepth`/`SolveWidth`/`spawnLen`) — it resizes shapes
  to hit the budget, which grows them further, the opposite of what the seeds need; parked in `BACKLOG.md` to be
  reconsidered as a targeted rule, not a solver.* Depends on G63-B, **G88, G89**. (review §4.2, §4.4, §4.5, §7.7)
