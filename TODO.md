# pgm-studio — TODO (current focus)

The **Now & Next** board — only the *current focus theme* lives here. Everything not in the immediate
slice is in **`BACKLOG.md`** (the long tail); shipped capabilities are in **`FEATURES.md`** (the Done
column). The three move left → right: **`BACKLOG.md` → `TODO.md` → `FEATURES.md`**.

**Holds only open work:** `[ ]` to-do, `[~]` in progress — **never `[x]`.** When a task ships, a commit
lands (its message references the id), the task **leaves this file**, and a line is added to `FEATURES.md`.
Board rules live in `CLAUDE.md` (§ "Status & task board").

**Three numbers are the author's and are not to be re-derived.** A protection region is at most **20×30**
blocks (`ST10`), a building footprint at most **20×20** (`ST9`), and the smallest room with no building over
it is **4×4** (`WX2`). A dressed prop's 192-cell ceiling (`HP3`) and a room building's 20×20 measure the same
concept since `WE71`, and holding them apart is a deliberate not-yet.

## Distance, and the walk every measure is taken with

`Geom.Walk` is the traversal now — eight-connected and octile, charging a climb in the blocks a player places,
counting a fall, slowing through water, narrowed per team where an `enter` rule bars one — and it runs over a
set that reads a surface as somewhere a player can stand rather than as any column holding a block.

**The walk is one; what is asked of it is not, and that is the ground this group spends.** Three answers taken
with it are settled and shared (`FEATURES.md`): *adjacent* is one predicate, `ContactGraph.Connects`, which the
fanned graph asks rather than answering its own; *a fork* belongs to a demand set and a door, because the same
hole answers differently to a side walking in and a side walking back out; and *dead ground* is one verb,
`Cells.Stretches`, which the plan tier and the built-world tier each ask at their own floor. What remains here
is the work that ground was settled for.

- [ ] **WE45 — `DR-PASS` still takes the widest side, and its width is absolute.** *Parked on a ruling: the
  number, and what "every side" exempts.* The wrong-rectangle fault is fixed (`FEATURES.md`). What is left is
  that the rule passes on **one** clear flank, so a building with three sides open and a two-block ledge on the
  fourth stands; and that five blocks is absolute, so a twenty-block passage with a fifteen-wide house in it
  leaves five and passes, which the author has ruled is not a way past.
  `docs/world-export/decoration.md`.

  **Why it is parked.** `DR-PASS` is a `Decline` — the building is dropped from the exported world — and the
  entry's own measurement says every-side at five fails 76 of 122 buildings. Ten would fail more. Three things
  have to be settled together: the depth; whether a flank over **void** is exempt (the rule text promises "a
  coast house is a house", and today `Band` fails a flank with any missing ground, so `&&` alone declines every
  coast house); and whether the verdict stays a `Decline` at that hit rate or becomes a `Complaint`.

  *122 buildings on 32 boards: 4 fail today. A side with ground and under 3 clear blocks fails 51, under 5
  fails 76. `whinnymoor/hut-w` reads E=24 W=23 S=2 N=22.*

- [ ] **B169 — Complain about spawn ground that carries nothing and contests nothing.** Raw size is not the
  test (author): a spawn seated on a large rectangle that *is* the map is fine, and Mirefast's 92-wide
  `steading` at least carries nine houses and two ramps. What fails is flat dead area around a spawn placed at
  the back. The rule id exists — **`SP2`**, "a spawn sits near the back of its lane, because the space behind
  a spawn is dead space" — and it composes with `ST9` (piece ≤ 20×20) and the door's approach (the first
  20×20 in front of the door kept clear), so the measure to add is *what is this ground for*, not how wide it is. The 15-block
  figure is a rule of thumb for the common case, not the rule.

  **`GroundCoverage` answers this directly once it is honest.** *Dead* is already exactly "ground with no
  route through it, no objective near it and nothing on it", named per patch with an area, a centroid and a
  walk to the nearest used ground — which is the measure this entry asks for, phrased as the picture rather
  than as a width. The walk it draws corridors with now prices a climb and a crossing and knows which
  ground is granted, so what remains is the picture itself rather than the measure under it.

  *author, 2026-08-14 · Weirgate's `yard` spans `x −40…40` against a spawn piece of `x −10…10`; Mirefast's
  `steading` is 92 wide for a 20-block spawn. The corpus does not support a spawn-isolation rule: `dtcm` puts a
  spawn a median 7.5 blocks from the board edge and the generated ones sit 5–15 out.*

- [ ] **G164 — interference: how much of one side's route the other side's route covers.** Every flow
  measure so far reads one traversal at a time, and a single route cannot express tension. Tension is two
  corridors laid over each other: the attacker pushing from a captured wool room toward the remaining
  objective, and the defender travelling from spawn to the same objective. The measurable is the fraction of
  the defender's corridor that the attacker's corridor also covers, computed on the cell mask the same way
  the corridors already are. Measured over 453 two-wool boards at `marker-id-1`: median **34%**, half or more
  on 27%, and **no board reaches zero** — passing the reinforcement lane is unavoidable on generated output.
  This is the term that gives a hub void a purpose the ways-round-a-void count cannot: on a holed hub the
  near way leaves 76% interference and the far way 37%, and the far way measurably reduces the collision on
  74% of the boards offering one, so a layout whose two ways collide equally has bought nothing. Derive side
  belongs beside `BoardDeriver`; the term belongs in `Evaluate/Terms`. It reads a pair of routes rather than
  one, so the origin "a captured wool room" comes from G168's post-capture state — until that exists,
  computing it once per wool treated as captured is the honest stand-in. Background and the full numbers:
  `docs/gameplay/match-flow.md` §2, §4.9.
