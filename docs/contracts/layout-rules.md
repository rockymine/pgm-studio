# Layout rules — the expert checklist (v3, corpus-measured)

The generator's actual content: per-role attachment rules, dimensions, and elevation defaults for
the plan composer (`docs/contracts/layout-generation.md` §3). v3 measures every rule against the
**ten-seed corpus** (`tools/seeds/*.plan.json`, sweep script `seed_stats`); this is the **freeze
candidate** — one item (the maxPlayers pass, see *Remaining seed work*) blocks the freeze. Tags:

- **[corpus]** — confirmed by measured seed evidence (seeds cited).
- **[expert]** — author-stated, not yet exercised by a seed.
- **[open]** — awaiting the author's call (see *Open questions*).
- **[guess]** — still mine.

Rules are numbered for correction by id. Distances in blocks unless marked *cells*. "Front" =
toward the map centre / the enemy; "back" = toward the map edge.

## Definitions

- **Lane** — an elongated transit piece: length noticeably exceeds width, it carries flow between
  a dead end / objective and a junction. Not the hub (the junction residual the lanes originate
  from), not a stepping stone (standalone).
- **Connection (a `land` interface) [expert]** — two pieces connect wherever they share **any
  positive-length straight border** — that shared terrain is walkable. A border **narrower than the
  corridor minimum** (< G2) is a **narrow seam**: still a connection, legal and common in staircases
  and ledges (a 5-block shared step is one island, not two). Connectivity is therefore **split from
  corridor quality**: whether an assembled route is wide enough to fight through is judged on the
  **assembled footprint** by lane-chain analysis, **not per seam**. **Corner / point contact never
  connects** — two pieces diagonally across a point stay separate, even when other shapes share that
  same point (a point is not a walkable border).

## G — Globals

- **G1 [expert]** Grid cell **5** by default, but a parameter (4 is viable for finer detail). More
  fundamentally: the plan is a **mini layout** — the checkered-paper scale *proxy* map authors
  already draw, not block-true dimensions. Grid-born "artificial" distances are expected and are
  resolved downstream by the scale + roughen passes (design doc §2, "the plan is a mini layout").
- **G2 [expert]** Minimum corridor width **10**; larger maps trend toward **15**.
- **G3 [corpus, revised]** The v2 width band (40–60) fit almost none of the authored corpus:
  measured 2-team fanned boards run **30–130 wide × 100–280 long** (elaborated seeds typically
  80–130 wide; `mirror-big-board` 280×130), 4-team squares **130–180**. Wide-frontline designs
  legitimately exceed the old cap. Numbers remain **decoupled from player count** — every seed
  still carries the stale `maxPlayers: 12` — so the envelope↔G8 coupling is re-derived in the
  parked maxPlayers pass before the composer treats these as sampling bounds.
- **G4 [corpus]** `rot_180` (2 teams) / `rot_90` (4 teams) are the defaults; `mirror_x`/`mirror_z`
  are valid and exercised end-to-end (`mirror-big-board` compiles and exports through the
  reflection fan).
- **G5 [expert, refined]** Void gaps between *individual* landmasses: **10–20** for the
  crossing a route *depends on* — but a longer hop is fine when the **same buildable region
  offers a shorter alternative** (`four-team-towers-big`'s 25 sits beside 15- and 20-hops in one
  region). Lint therefore judges a region's **minimal** crossing, not every pair. Total crossing
  40–60.
- **G6 [expert]** Build headroom above the island surface: **≥20, up to ~40**. Island terrain
  height **5–20**. **The sky-layer smell:** low, flat terrain under a tall build cap casts a
  second play layer into the sky — players dig the base to bedrock, defend from above, and the
  match stalemates as coverless sky bow-fighting. So terrain wants height variation, and the cap
  is calibrated to the terrain, not set generously. Observer platform: out of player reach —
  **~5 above the build cap**, or off to the side beyond any build zone.
- **G7 [expert]** Follows G5: a single required-path hop stays ≤ **~20**; anything longer is a
  chain of hops (stones) summing to the 40–60 total crossing.
- **G8 [expert, new]** Map size is driven by the intended player count — `maxPlayers` is an
  *input* to the board envelope, not an afterthought.

## SP — Spawn

- **SP1 [expert]** The frontline→wool path never passes **through** the spawn (protection regions
  enforce this anyway); it **may pass around it** on a wide or split lane.
- **SP2 [expert]** Near the **back** of its lane — otherwise the space behind spawn is dead space
  with no purpose. (The current lint approximates "back" per-piece and misreads spawns placed
  mid-chain; honest measurement needs lane chains — `G24`.)
- **SP3 [corpus]** Faces the enemy by default; deliberate side-facing exceptions exist
  (`odd-facing-three-wool`, `four-team-wool-two-sided`, `mirror-big-board` all face left/right
  along their lane rather than dead at mid).
- **SP4 [corpus]** Raised spawns measured across the corpus: **+0 to +10** over base (the three
  base seeds flat; elaborated seeds +2/+4/+4/+4/+8/+8/**+10** — `mirror-big-board` spawns on the
  highest plateau). Common band **+4..+8**.
- **SP5 [expert]** Spawn structure (cube, protection) is stamped at export; the stamp style may
  evolve. The plan reserves the area and floor level only.
- **SP6 [corpus]** Spawn **can** be `gap`-only (an isolated spawn island) — `isolated-spawn` and
  `isolated-spawn-approaches` both build it.
- **SP7 [corpus]** Resource placement (iron): **beside or ahead** of the spawn — players face
  mid and must see it. Iron *behind* the spawn is a bad smell (unseen, dead space). Corpus: 3
  beside, 2 ahead, none behind. (An earlier "violation" on `four-team-wool-two-sided` was a
  measurement artifact of the facing-semantics bug — the spawn points straight at its iron.)

## WL — Wool room

- **WL1 [corpus]** At the far/back end of a dead-end lane, inset ~**5**. Two-sided wools are
  authored twice (`four-team-wool-two-sided`: two stepped land seams into the room;
  `mirror-big-board`).
- **WL2 [corpus]** On a different lane than the spawn; wool↔spawn ≥ **20** — all 17 corpus pairs
  pass, tightest 22.4 (the base seeds), typical 36–58, up to 101 on the big board.
- **WL3 [expert, clarified]** The plan records only the wool's position and floor level; the
  physical room (cage, pedestal — the 8×8 stamp today) is stamped at export. Requirement on the
  plan: the wool sits on a **flat plateau covering at least the stamp footprint and extending to
  the lane edges** (even in a 15-wide lane, the room area is flat edge-to-edge).
- **WL4 [expert]** Isolated-wool variant: the connecting `gap` is commonly **10–20**; the height
  delta varies in size *and sign* (see EL2).
- **WL5 [expert, re-anchored]** Wool-approach elevation: the room plateau itself is flat (WL3);
  the approach climbs in **steps 1–5 blocks deep**. The v2 cap (+6 total) measured room height
  *vs base*, which the corpus exceeds routinely (+8 three times, +10 once) — but a high room
  beside an equally high spawn is no climb at all. The meaningful metric is the **approach climb
  along the attacker's path**, measurable once climbs land (`G29`); until then the cap is
  provisional and the lint should not fire on room-vs-base height.
- **WL6 [expert]** 1–3 wools per team, each on a **distinct** lane.
- **WL7 [corpus]** Separation between a team's wools, measured over 8 multi-wool pairs:
  **46–143** blocks (46.1 / 58.3 / 64 / 70 / 75 / 85.6 / 95.5 / 143). Working minimum ≈**45**.
- **WL8 [expert, new]** Wool approach routes: the default is a **single chokepoint route**;
  real maps sometimes add **alternative routes** to the wool (and then a build zone may touch the
  wool room — see BZ5). **[seed-needed]**

## LN — Lane

- **LN1 [corpus]** Width **10** base — piece min-dims across 150 corpus pieces: 5-wide ×54 (the
  step/ledge idiom, **not** corridors), 10 ×81, 15 ×15, 20+ ×0 (the ">20 near mid/spawn" case is
  authored via assembled footprints, not single pieces). The stretch **in front of a wool stays
  ≤ ~16**.
- **LN2 [expert]** Length **20–50** before a junction or dead end; a lane may include a
  turn/twist (the L-shape case).
- **LN3 [expert]** Wool lanes dead-end at the back; the front end stops at the void edge
  (frontline) or at the hub. (Lane defined above.)
- **LN4 [expert, clarified]** Restated plainly in *Definitions*: pieces join along **any** shared
  positive-length border (a sub-corridor border is a legal *narrow seam*, not a break) — never at a
  bare corner/point.

## HB — Hub / connector

- **HB1 [expert]** Connector/crossbar width: **10 is the floor** (smallest maps); **15 is the
  widespread value**.
- **HB2 [seed]** Every frontline→wool path crosses ≥1 hub/connector piece. (Unchallenged;
  pending the new seeds.)
- **HB3 [expert]** Hub-widens-into-plaza (1.5–2× lane width) is wanted **at plan level**, not
  left to roughen.

## FR — Frontline

- **FR1+FR2 [expert, merged]** There is **no overlap/abut rule**. The seed's 5-block overlap was
  authoring simplification (aligning a simple rect to one front-end). Build zones are simple
  rects; **overlapping terrain is allowed and harmless** — the alternative is carving with
  negative regions or region unions, needless complexity. What matters is the buildable span
  over the void; the plan editor authors zones precisely.
- **FR3 [corpus]** Defenders-hold-high-ground-behind-the-frontline is **common, never strict** —
  frontline towers are authored (`four-team-towers-big`, surfaces to 17 at the front;
  `rotate-wide-frontline`'s raised mid-facing steps).
- **FR4 [expert, split]** Two distinct "angles of attack":
  - **Team approaches** — ways to reach the enemy's side: **1–3** (corpus: 1 on six seeds, 3 on
    three); 1 is acceptable only if it is wide.
  - **Wool approaches** — ways to reach a wool room: WL8.

## MD — Mid / stepping stones

- **MD1 [expert]** Stones vary: 2×2 cells, 2×3, larger. Raised, level, or (rarely) **lowered**
  relative to base terrain.
- **MD2 [expert]** Gap values per G5 (10–20 per hop).
- **MD3 [expert → CT]** A team's side reads as a **once-connected island the author cut apart**.
  Purpose: harder/riskier wool access, defenders slowed between spawn and wool, retreat over
  fragile player-made bridges instead of solid terrain. Formalized in the **CT section**
  (below) — team-side cutting per CT5; the mid follows the interface/carving reading (CT1).
- **MD4 [expert]** Stones sit entirely inside the build zone.
- **MD5 [expert]** Large neutral mid islands: rare; **not v1**.

## CT — The mid interface & fragmentation (read from the closure) [expert]

Every plan has a **closure**: its terrain pieces ∪ its build zones treated as land. A playable map's
closure is **one connected mass** — that is what the traversability gate proves, and all ten seeds
pass it. Reading the seeds backwards from their closures gives the fragmentation grammar — but the
mid and the team sides fragment **differently**: the mid is *carved*, the team side is *cut*.

- **CT1 — the mid is an interface, not a cut.** There is no team-separation cut — the symmetry
  axis already plays that part. What the author shapes as "the middle" is the **interface between
  the two team territories**, and that interface always connects through bridge zones. Its
  physical forms in the corpus: a **single clean zone** (possibly holding islands); **two or more
  parallel zones** (parallel team approaches); one **big connecting zone**; a **grid** — islands
  placed in a grid with zones joining the opposite islands (not the AABB of all of them: with four
  islands the centre stays free, bridges + islands forming a hash `#`).
- **CT2 — team side vs mid: the true interface.** A team's side is *at least* the islands holding
  its spawn and wools plus the **minimum other islands** needed to connect them. Mid islands are
  what remains, claimed by closeness to the map's actual middle point. This assignment — not any
  cut line — is the boundary the rules are based on.
- **CT3 — fragmentation depth.** Fragmentation means **many hops between small islands** (the
  hash case). The per-map question is how deep that regime reaches toward the team side.
  Individual hops keep G5's 10–20; longer total crossings are chains of hops with fragments
  between.
- **CT4 — the island-size gradient [corpus hypothesis].** Across the corpus it should hold that
  islands **grow** with distance from the centre, and **stepping stones** — islands fully
  submerged in a build zone, or small islands with exactly two build-zone interfaces — **thin
  out** toward the team side. (MD1/MD4 describe the stones themselves.)
- **CT5 — carve the mid, cut the team side.** "Cut" is the wrong picture for the middle — it can
  hold many islands; the mid operator is **carving**: shaping the interface's islands and zones
  directly into one of CT1's forms. Cutting belongs to the **team side**: severing a piece from
  its parent isolates it behind a bridge — the isolated wool (WL4), the isolated spawn (SP6) —
  and, deliberate variants aside, each team side stays internally land-traversable after cutting.
- **CT6 — the fragmented-island "seed" is the whole corpus.** No dedicated seed is needed: every
  seed *is* a fragmented closure, and the interface statistics are the measured zone/hop numbers.

## BZ — Build zones

- **BZ1 [expert]** Superseded by FR1+FR2: zones are authored precisely in the plan editor;
  terrain overlap is permitted, not meaningful.
- **BZ2 [expert]** Lane backs (spawn, wool) sit **outside** the buildable area. Lanes and build
  zones *intentionally restrict and guide* the player — their function ensures gameplay and flow;
  a map is not an open greenfield playground. (The "narrower than the island" phrasing is
  dropped; the outside-ness is the rule.)
- **BZ3 [corpus]** Directed bridge: **10** wide dominates (26 of 43 corpus zones); 5-wide tight
  chokes exist (×5, lint-flagged, intentional); 15+ for open bands (×12).
- **BZ4 [expert]** 4-team: zones connect all teams; often with a **hole at the centre** so
  players must walk/bridge around it rather than straight across.
- **BZ5 [expert, retired as a prohibition]** Build zones **may touch spawn pieces** — a zone at
  the spawn is a real motif: the **defender-egress bridge** (`four-team-wool-two-sided`: the
  spawn's second exit is a bridge mainly for defenders rotating to their wool; attackers push the
  other crossings). No proximity rule; the old lint is dropped. Wool rooms may also be touched
  (WL8 alternative-approach variants).

## EL — Elevation

- **EL1 [corpus]** Plateau step unit: **2**. The corpus surface palette is base 9 + even steps
  (9/11/13/15/17/19 — all odd values), so every one of the 137 measured land-interface deltas is
  even by construction: histogram Δ0 ×47, Δ2 ×73, Δ4 ×10, Δ6 ×4, Δ8+ ×3.
- **EL2 [expert]** Height deltas across `gap`s work **both ways**: attacker builds up and arrives
  low (defensive device), or the defended wool sits low and the defender holds height advantage
  *inside* the room.
- **EL3 [expert]** `land` interfaces: walkable step ≤1; 2–3 only as an explicit jump/ledge
  feature; ≥4 is either a **cliff** (per EL6, needing a `cliffs` mark) or a **stepped path edge**
  (no mark — the seam borders a staircase route).
- **EL4 [expert]** Per island: base + up to **2** raised sections (not 1). Roughen never changes
  levels, only outlines.
- **EL5 [corpus]** Cliffs (one-way drops): in v1 and now in use — `odd-facing-three-wool` marks
  3 (incl. the pit pair), `mirror-big-board` 2 (the long spawn-side seam + the 15-long seam).
- **EL6 [expert, new]** **Cliff qualification** — what separates a real cliff from a stepped path
  edge (the seam beside a staircase/hairpin): a cliff (a) cuts the **full width of a lane**,
  (b) is **≥10 blocks** wide, and (c) carries **Δ≥6**, *or* a shallow **Δ4 that walls a pit**
  (EL7's opposing-cliff geometry) with no gentle bypass — a lone Δ4 dead-end step-up is just a
  staircase edge, however wide. Of the corpus's 17 Δ≥4 seams this reproduces the author's
  verdicts exactly: rotate-wide-frontline 0 (5-wide strips + one lone step-up), mirror-big-board
  2 (the spawn-plateau seam Δ8 and the east cliff face Δ6), odd-facing 3 (the Δ8 jump + both pit
  walls).
- **EL7 [expert, new]** **The pit** — twin opposing cliffs flanking a wool approach
  (`odd-facing-three-wool`): slows attackers like a bridge-gap but more forgivingly (a fall is
  recoverable bridging, not void), lets defenders reach bedrock faster, and the air exposure
  prevents tunneling to the wool. A gentler alternative to placing a build-zone gap hard against
  the room.

## PC — Pieces are anonymous

- **PC-S retired [expert]** The old per-seam *sliver* lint (PC-S — a shared border below the corridor
  minimum flagged as suspect) is **gone**: a narrow seam is legal connecting geometry per *Definitions*,
  so there is no per-seam width lint. Corridor quality of an assembled footprint is measured by
  lane-chain analysis, not seam by seam. **PC-C stays** — a bare corner between pieces not already in the
  same land component is still linted (a point never connects).

- **PC1 [expert]** Pieces carry no semantic role by default — a piece is a modeling unit (cut for
  elevation, cornering, or interface-driving), and one *lane* is typically several pieces. Meaning
  is **derived from the assembled graph**: a lane = a maximal chain of pieces joined by full-width
  land interfaces with no branching (elevation steps and corners do not break it); a hub = a
  junction **region** (degree ≥3 in the walk graph, e.g. the "plus" in front of a spawn), which may
  sit mid-piece and is never reliably a whole piece; a degree-2 corner is not a hub; a mid /
  stepping-stone = a markerless standalone piece inside a build area.
- **PC2 [expert]** Route *purposes* are contextual, never authored: the same piece can be defender
  egress, an attack route, and the shortest wool-to-wool rotation, depending on which team's spawn,
  wools, and bridges you measure from (the isolated-spawn seed's centre plate is all three).
- **PC3 [expert]** Two roles remain explicitly authorable because they carry intent, and both are
  **optional**: `wool-room` and `spawn` (see ST1/ST2). Everything else is `piece`.

## ST — Stamped structures (export)

- **ST1 [expert]** *Wool room piece* (optional): defines the full room **region**; its footprint is
  stamped **solid bedrock from y=0 to its floor** (no tunnelling in from below); a **redstone line
  with a torch at either end** lies on the last block row at the room's entrance interface — the
  conventional marker for where entrance protection begins. The editor renders terrain↔wool-room
  interfaces **red**.
- **ST2 [expert]** *Spawn piece* (optional): defines the spawn **region**. Iron placed inside it is
  **auto-renewed** in the generated XML (load-bearing for gameplay); lint: when a spawn piece
  exists, iron markers belong inside it. Spawns have no redstone line.
- **ST3 [expert]** *Iron structure*: an iron marker stamps a **4×4×4 iron-block cube**.
- **ST4 [corpus]** *Pre-built wall*: 2 blocks thick, full seam width, top = approach side +4,
  down to y=0. Corpus pattern (11 walls over 5 seeds): walls sit on **gentle seams** — every
  marked interface has Δ ∈ {0, ±2} and border 10–15; nobody walls a cliff. Narrow seams are
  legal wall carriers.

## Facing semantics [expert]

Marker `facing` is **absolute board directions** — front = −z, back = +z, left = −x, right = +x
on the authored unit, fanned per orbit image. (The editor always meant this; the compiler briefly
interpreted "front" as toward-the-centre, which mis-yawed four seeds and mis-measured one iron —
both corrected.)

## Remaining seed work

The ten-seed corpus covers the entire original shopping list:

1. ~~cliff-marked seed~~ — **done**: five `cliffs` marks landed (mirror-big-board ×2,
   odd-facing ×3) under EL6.
2. ~~fragmented-island~~ — **resolved without a seed**: fragmentation is the closure reading
   (CT1–CT6); every seed is a fragmented closure and the interface statistics are already
   measured.
3. **maxPlayers pass** — honest player counts on all ten seeds, re-deriving the G3↔G8 envelope
   coupling. **The single remaining freeze blocker.**
4. ~~behind-spawn iron~~ — retracted (facing-semantics artifact; the iron is ahead).

## Resolved this round (was: freeze blockers)

1. **BZ5** — retired as a prohibition; the defender-egress bridge at spawn is a motif.
2. **Cliffs** — EL6 qualification encodes the author's criteria; marks added to mirror-big-board
   (2) and odd-facing (3); rotate-wide-frontline's seams are stepped edges, unmarked by design.
3. **G5** — refined to the region's minimal crossing (long hops beside shorter ones are fine).
4. **SP7 "violation"** — retracted (facing-semantics measurement bug; iron is ahead).
5. **CT1/CT4 revised per the author** — no team-separation cut exists (the symmetry axis plays
   that part); the mid is the *interface between team territories*, always connected through
   bridge zones, in four physical forms (clean zone / parallel zones / big connector / grid-`#`).
   Carving replaced cutting as the mid operator (CT5); team-side vs mid assignment is
   spawn+wools+minimal-connectors vs centre-proximity (CT2); the island-size gradient and
   stepping-stone falloff are pinned as CT4's corpus hypothesis.

## Correction protocol

Reply by rule id. Remaining before freeze: the maxPlayers pass — then this document **freezes as
the composer's v1 rule set**.
